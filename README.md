# Cloud Engineer Portfolio

This repository contains hands-on, production-style AWS infrastructure projects
designed to demonstrate Cloud Engineering skills.

All projects are built using Terraform and follow AWS best practices for 
security, scalability, reliability, and cost efficiency.

This portfolio is intended for Cloud Engineer, DevOps Engineer, and Platform
Engineer roles.

# Skills Demonstrated

- AWS Networking (VPC, Subnets, Route Tables, NAT, IGW)
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- IAM & Security (least privilege, KMS, Secrets Manager)
- Compute (EC2, ALB, Auto Scaling)
- Serverless (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB)
- Monitoring & Logging (CloudWatch, Alarms)
- CI/CD Automation (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)
- Cost Optimisation & Reliability Engineering

## Projects

| Project | Description |
|------|-----------|
| **Production VPC** | Multi-AZ VPC with public/private subnets, NAT Gateway, and secure networking
| **EC2 + ALB + Auto Scaling** | Highly available compute layer deployed with Terraform
| **Serverless API** | Lambda-based REST API with API Gateway and DynamoDB
| **CI/CD Pipeline** | Automated Terraform deployment using GitHub Actions
| **Monitoring & Cost Optimization** | CloudWatch alarms, budgets, and cost controls

Each project includes:
- Terraform source code
- Architecture diagram
- Design decisions and tradeoffs
- Security and scalability considerations
- Deployment instructions

## Design Principles

- **Automation first**
- **Least privilege security**
- **Multi-AZ resilience**
- **Cost-aware architecture**
- **Readable, maintainable infrastructure code**

## How to Use This Repository

Each project can be deployed independently.
Refer to the individual project README files for setup instructions,
architecture explanations, and diagrams.
