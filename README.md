# Cloud Engineer Portfolio

This repository contains hands-on production style AWS infrastructure projects
designed to demonstrate Cloud Engineering skills.

All projects are built using Terraform and follow AWS best practices for 
security, scalability, reliability, and cost efficiency.

This portfolio is intended for Cloud Engineer, DevOps Engineer and Platform
Engineer roles.

# Skills Demonstrated

- AWS Networking (VPC, Subnets, Route Tables, NAT, IGW)
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Ansible)
- IAM & Security (least privilege, KMS, Secrets Manager)
- Compute (EC2, ALB, Auto Scaling)
- Serverless (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB)
- Monitoring & Logging (CloudWatch, Cloudtrail, Alarms)
- Containerisation (Docker, Kubernetes, EKS)
- CI/CD Automation (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)
- Cost Optimisation & Reliability Engineering

## Projects

| Project | Description |
|------|-----------|
| **Production VPC + EC2 + ALB + Auto Scaling** | Highly available compute layer deployed with Terraform
| **Serverless API** | Lambda based HTTP API with API Gateway and DynamoDB, S3, Cloudfront
| **CI/CD Pipeline** | Automated Terraform deployment using GitHub Actions
| **Monitoring, Security & Cost Optimisation** | Cloudtrail, CloudWatch alarms, Least privilege, budgets and cost controls
| **Containerisation & Orchestration** | Container Orchestration with EKS

Each project includes:
- Terraform source code
- Architecture diagram
- Design decisions and tradeoffs
- Security and scalability considerations
- Deployment instructions

## Design Principles

- **Automation first**
- **Least privilege security**
